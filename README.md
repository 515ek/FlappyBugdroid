# FlappyBugdroid
CG Project

## Summary
This project is implemented to play a game inspired by the android 5.0 Easter egg.
The objective of the game is to pass through each lollipop barrier by clicking left mouse button to keep Bugdroid (Android Mascot) form hitting the ground.
Hitting the Bugdroid to any barrier or the ground will end the game.
